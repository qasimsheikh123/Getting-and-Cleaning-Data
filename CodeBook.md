This codebook describes the data and variables in "tidy_data.txt"

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Library and describes measurements from the sensors of a Samsung Galaxy S 
smartphone attached to subjects undergoing physical activity testing. There are various indicators measuring different
movement and speed variables for subjects that are grouped into testing and training categories. We are interested in 
variables that measure the mean and standard deviation of these measurements and separate the data so as to only include these
measurements. 

Identifiers in the dataset include subject and activity, with subject giving an id for which person's measurements are taken
and activity giving an id for one of six categories, which are as follows:

1. WALKING: the subject was walking
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS: the subject was walking up stairs
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: the subject was walking down stairs
4. SITTING: the subject was sitting
5. STANDING: the subject was standing
6. LAYING: the subject was laying

The variables measured for each subject and activity are various sensor measurements from the Galaxy S smartphone. They 
are as follows:

These are only the variables that measured standard deviation and means of measurements, down from the original dataset
which included indicators for other statistical measurements
